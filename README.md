# IoT Library Space Management System

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the IoT Library Space Management System. This project is specifically designed for the 2nd floor of the Sir Duncan Rice Library at the University of Aberdeen. Our goal is to streamline the utilization and monitoring of space using IoT technologies to ensure an efficient and enhanced library experience for all users.

## Features
